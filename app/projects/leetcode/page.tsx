                a week. Normally, I just do the daily LeetCode, but occasionally I do seek out problems

                Here are my NeetCode 150 stats! You can see the breakdown by category in the chart. I started
                doing NeetCode problems over my 2023-2024 winter break because one of my friends challenged
                me to complete all of them. As you can see, I&apos;m making good progress. My goal is to finish all
                NeetCode problems by Summer 2024. Check out my progress so far!

                Honestly, going through the NeetCode 150 was a really good experience for me.
                I took a class on Data Structures and Algorithms a while ago, so topics like Binary Search,
                Trees, Linked Lists, and Stacks all went very smoothly for me. As for topics like Greedy Algorithm
                Design, and Sliding Windows, this challenge refamiliarized me with those crucial skills.
            </p>
            <p className="pb-2">
                I think the best part of going through the NeetCode 150 was finally wrapping my head around 2D DP.
                I&apos;d been doing 1D DP problems prior to starting this challenge, and so 1D problems went like
                clockwork for me. However, I&apos;d never done a 2D DP problem successfully (at least not in the DP way;
                I may have cheesed them using <code>functools.lru_cache</code>), but doing this challenge pushed
                me to read several online articles to finally start to get a small grasp and then do a bunch of practice
                problems to cement those thought patterns into my mind.
            </p>
            <p className="pb-2">
                Overall, I would definitely recommend the NeetCode 150. It helped me brush up on my
                skills so much. Hopefully, those skills will land me an internship ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž. Till then, may your
                code always run first try!
